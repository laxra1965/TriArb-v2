New Goal: Port the client-side engine to a server-side architecture.
Phase 1: Backend Migration & Core API Development (Weeks 1-3)
The #1 priority is to get your tested JavaScript logic running on a server that you control.
Technology Stack Choice:
Backend: Node.js with Express.js. Since your existing code is JavaScript, this is the most direct and fastest path. You can reuse significant portions of your arbitrage logic.
Database: PostgreSQL. This recommendation remains unchanged. It is the best choice for securely managing user data, subscriptions, and trade records.
Key Libraries: ccxt (the Node.js version is just as powerful), axios (for any other API calls), pg (for connecting to PostgreSQL), bcrypt (for hashing passwords), jsonwebtoken (for auth), crypto-js (for encrypting API keys).
Task: Port the Arbitrage Logic to a Node.js Worker:
Action: Create a new Node.js project. Isolate the arbitrage logic (market scanning, opportunity calculation, and trade execution) from your index.html and place it into a separate worker.js file.
Modification: Replace browser-specific functions (like fetch or DOM manipulation) with Node.js equivalents. The ccxt library will handle all interactions with exchanges. This worker will be designed to run 24/7 on the server.
Task: Build the Backend API Server (Express.js):
Action: Create the API that will allow your future frontend and the worker to communicate with the database.
Essential Endpoints:
POST /api/users/register: Create a new user in the PostgreSQL database (with a hashed password).
POST /api/users/login: Authenticate a user and return a JSON Web Token (JWT).
POST /api/keys: Endpoint for a logged-in user to submit their exchange API keys. These keys will be encrypted using crypto-js before being saved to the database.
POST /api/bot/toggle: Allow the user to start or stop the bot for their account. This will simply flip a boolean (is_active) in the users table.
Task: Database Schema (PostgreSQL):
Action: Define the tables.
Tables:
users: id, email, password_hash, subscription_status, is_active.
api_keys: user_id, exchange, encrypted_api_key, encrypted_secret.
trades: user_id, trade_details, profit, timestamp.
Phase 2: The New "Thin Client" Frontend (Weeks 4-5)
Your old index.html was the engine. The new frontend will be a simple, secure dashboard that only talks to your backend. All the heavy lifting happens on your server.
Technology: React (using Create React App) or Vue.js.
Task: Build the User Interface:
Login/Register Pages: Forms that call the /register and /login endpoints on your backend.
Dashboard Page (Protected): This page is only accessible after logging in.
Displays bot status (is_active from the backend).
Shows trade history and profit by fetching data from your backend API.
Contains the "Start/Stop Bot" button which calls the /api/bot/toggle endpoint.
Settings Page (Protected): A secure form for submitting API keys that sends them directly to your backend's /api/keys endpoint over HTTPS. No trading logic or secret keys will exist in the frontend code.
Phase 3: Integration, Subscription, and Deployment (Weeks 6-7)
This phase ties everything together into a commercial product.
Task: Connect the Worker to the Database:
Action: Modify the worker.js arbitrage engine.
New Logic:
On a loop, fetch all users from the database where is_active is true.
For each active user, retrieve their encrypted API keys.
Decrypt the keys in memory just long enough to perform the scanning and trading operations for that user.
When a trade is executed, record the result in the trades table in the database.
Task: Subscription Integration:
Action: Integrate Stripe into your backend.
Process:
Create subscription plans in your Stripe dashboard.
Use Stripe Elements on your frontend for a secure payment form.
Create backend endpoints (/api/subscribe) to handle payment processing.
Set up a Stripe Webhook to listen for payment events. When a payment_success event is received, update the user's subscription_status in your PostgreSQL database. The worker will only trade for users with an active subscription.
Task: Deployment:
Backend: Deploy the Node.js application (API server and worker) to a service like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS EC2. Use a process manager like pm2 to keep it running 24/7.
Database: Use a managed database service like AWS RDS for PostgreSQL or DigitalOcean Managed Databases.
Frontend: Deploy the static React/Vue app to a fast, simple hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
